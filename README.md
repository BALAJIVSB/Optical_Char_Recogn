Optical Character Recognition
===============================================
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that enables the conversion of printed or handwritten text into machine-encoded text. It uses advanced algorithms and pattern recognition techniques to analyze scanned documents, images, or even live video streams, extracting the characters present and translating them into editable and searchable digital text. OCR has revolutionized various industries by automating data entry processes, improving accessibility for visually impaired individuals, and enabling efficient document management.


This project takes the image as the input, performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Pytesseract and writes the text that is present in the image to a file and gives us the output.
